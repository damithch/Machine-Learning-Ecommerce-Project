Ecommerce Sales Prediction
This repository contains Python code and Jupyter Notebooks for analyzing and predicting ecommerce sales using various data analysis techniques and machine learning models.

Overview
The project uses publicly available datasets from Kaggle to predict sales in the ecommerce sector. By exploring data such as product categories, prices, discounts, customer segments, and marketing spend, we aim to create a model that predicts the number of units sold and the total sales.

Project Structure
Jupyter Notebooks: The primary notebooks for data exploration, cleaning, visualization, and model training.
Python Scripts: Helper Python scripts for data processing, feature engineering, and model deployment.
Dataset: The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle, providing detailed information about sales, customer demographics, and marketing efforts.
Libraries Used
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
NumPy: For numerical operations.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization.
scikit-learn: For building machine learning models.
Datasets
The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle and includes the following columns:

Date: Date of the transaction.
Product_Category: The category of the product.
Price: Price of the product.
Discount: Discount applied to the product.
Customer_Segment: Segment of the customer (e.g., Occasional, Premium).
Marketing_Spend: Marketing spend for the product.
Units_Sold: The number of units sold.
Objective
The primary goal of this project is to predict the Units_Sold based on various factors like price, discount, marketing spend, and customer segment. Through this, we can provide insights into which factors influence sales the most and improve decision-making for ecommerce businesses.
